# Outlook Add-ins

This folder contains two projects:

* a Reactor Starter project
* a Reactor Demo project

## Reactor

Reactor is a tool for quickly answering emails. 

## Reactor Starter

The project has a starter project generated with the Office Yeoman generator.

## Reactor Demo

The ReactorDemo project is written using JavaScript and was built using Visual Studio.

## Exercises

You can use the ReactorDemo project directly if you are using Visual Studio or have it installed (you will need the Office extensions installed).

Another exercise is to use the code from ReactorDemo and use it to build out the same functionality in ReactorStarter using copy/paste. You can then build the ReactorDemo using only the "modern" toolchain.
