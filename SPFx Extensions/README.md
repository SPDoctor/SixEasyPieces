# SPFx Extensions

In addition to the sample SPFxExt, you can clone the [OfficeDev Training repo on SharePoint Framework extensions](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-training-spfx-extensions):

```
git clone https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-training-spfx-extensions.git
```

This includes samples for Field Customizers and List View Command Sets, as well as a lab manual so you can build these yourself.
